summary: >
  Establishes Output Governance as a mandatory pre-release control layer
  in AI systems. The paper introduces Shadow Exposure as a governed
  observation phase where real-world inputs are evaluated without
  execution authority. By enforcing threshold-based triggers,
  machine-in-the-loop escalation, and explicit release criteria,
  the framework reframes deployment as a graduated privilege
  rather than a binary decision.

notes: >
  Conceptual governance architecture intended for public thought leadership.
  Complements WP-07 and WP-08 by extending governance beyond learning
  and selection into output authority control. Focuses on preventing
  real-world impact before trust is earned through evidence.
