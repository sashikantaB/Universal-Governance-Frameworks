patent_notes: >
  Conceptual governance framework defining labeling as a governed decision
  process with graduated authority, confidence-based escalation, discard
  rules, and full label lineage. No annotation algorithms, thresholds,
  tooling, or implementation details disclosed.

  - Confidence-Based Escalation
  - Label Lineage and Traceability
  - Preventive Data Contamination Control

lifecycle_scope:
  - Data Preparation
  - Data Labeling and Annotation
  - Pre-Training Quality Assurance
  - Bias Formation Prevention
  - Training Data Approval

summary: >
  Establishes Data Governance in Labeling as a missing preventive control
  layer in AI systems. The paper reframes annotation as a governed,
  authority-based decision process by introducing graduated trust,
  confidence-driven escalation, discard rules, bias monitoring, and full
  label lineage. It positions labeling as a primary source of bias and
  instability that must be governed before training begins.

notes: >
  Conceptual governance architecture intended for public thought leadership.
  Complements WP-07 and WP-08 by extending training-time governance upstream
  into data preparation and labeling, ensuring that learning systems are
  trained only on accountable, bias-controlled, and auditable annotations.
