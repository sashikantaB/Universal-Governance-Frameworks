# White Paper XVI  
## Interactive Governance Intelligence (IGI): A Runtime Governance Framework for Responsible AI Evolution

**Author:** Sashikanta Barik  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Domain:** AI Governance • Runtime Safety • Post-Deployment Alignment

---

## Overview

This white paper introduces **Interactive Governance Intelligence (IGI)** — a runtime governance framework that transforms filtered, flagged, and safety-relevant human–AI interactions into **structured governance intelligence**.

Rather than discarding unsafe or rejected prompts, IGI treats them as **signals of alignment gaps, emerging risk patterns, and unmet system intent**. By governing these signals explicitly, the framework enables responsible AI evolution without compromising safety, privacy, or trust.

## Core Thesis

> Responsible AI systems must learn not only from what they answer, but from what they refuse — under strict governance control.

Filtered interactions are not failures; they are **governance-relevant data points**.  
IGI shifts post-deployment governance from passive monitoring to **active, intelligence-driven alignment**.

## Key Contributions

- **Runtime Governance Intelligence:** Elevates filtered and flagged prompts into governed alignment signals  
- **Dual-Channel Architecture:** Separates real-time inference from governance intelligence processing  
- **Preventive Alignment Evolution:** Enables targeted retraining and policy refinement based on real-world use  
- **Privacy-Preserving Oversight:** Signal minimization, classification, and anonymization by design  
- **Auditability & Accountability:** Traceable governance decisions tied to deployment behavior

---

## Why This Paper Matters

- Reduces blind spots in post-deployment AI governance  
- Prevents reactive, broad-scale retraining  
- Improves alignment precision using real usage signals  
- Strengthens regulatory and audit readiness  
- Establishes governance continuity beyond training time

## Relationship to Other Papers

This paper builds upon and extends:

- **WP-11 Data Governance Labeling:** Governs how interaction signals are classified and contextualized  
- **WP-12 Continuous Feedback Governance:** Formalizes feedback as an intelligence system, not raw data  
- **WP-13 Algorithm & Hyperparameter Governance:** Informs selective, governance-approved retraining  
- **WP-14 Bias-First AI Governance:** Detects emerging bias patterns during deployment  
- **WP-15 Data Preprocessing Governance:** Ensures runtime signals do not bypass data lineage controls  

WP-16 establishes the **runtime intelligence layer** in the AI Governance series.
