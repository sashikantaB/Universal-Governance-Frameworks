summary: >
  Introduces Interactive Governance Intelligence (IGI), a runtime governance
  framework that treats filtered and safety-relevant human–AI interaction
  signals as first-class governance intelligence. Enables continuous,
  auditable, and privacy-preserving AI system evolution after deployment.

notes: >
  Conceptual paper intended for public dissemination. Emphasizes post-deployment
  governance, separation of inference and governance intelligence, and alignment
  with emerging global AI safety and regulatory expectations.
