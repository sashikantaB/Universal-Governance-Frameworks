summary: >
  Introduces a governance-first architecture for enforcing ethical alignment
  during AI training rather than at inference time. The paper proposes
  Dharma-Gate as a conceptual control that evaluates and ejects ethically
  misaligned data prior to learning, while preserving training continuity
  and generating audit-ready governance signals.

notes: >
  This paper extends the philosophical foundations of White Paper I into
  a concrete training-time governance mechanism. It is intentionally
  non-operational and designed for public discussion, regulatory alignment,
  and research-oriented governance exploration.
