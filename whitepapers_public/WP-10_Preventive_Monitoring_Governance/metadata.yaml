summary: >
  Introduces a preventive monitoring governance framework for AI systems,
  shifting oversight from reactive threshold breaches to proactive risk
  stabilization. Establishes multi-level governance thresholds, preventive
  interventions at input, learning, and model levels, and machine-in-the-loop
  escalation to improve fairness, resilience, and operational continuity.

notes: >
  Conceptual architecture intended for public research and thought leadership.
  Complements WP-09 by operationalizing output governance with pre-breach
  interventions and preventive monitoring mechanisms for real-time AI systems.
