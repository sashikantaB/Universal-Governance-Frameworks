summary: >
  Establishes a governance-first framework for web data collection in AI systems.
  Introduces authority-approved source whitelists, AI-assisted source verification,
  and controlled whitelist evolution to prevent misinformation, hallucination,
  and ungoverned knowledge ingestion before training.

notes: >
  Conceptual paper intended for public dissemination. Emphasizes preventive,
  shift-left governance at the data collection layer, aligning with frontier AI
  safety practices and avoiding implementation-specific or proprietary claims.
