patent_notes: >
  Conceptual governance framework focused on learning-state accountability,
  convergence control, and reversibility. No algorithms, thresholds, or
  implementation details disclosed.

governance_focus:
  - Learning-State Accountability
  - Bias Prevention Before Convergence
  - Training Reversibility
  - Convergence Integrity Monitoring
  - Explainability Through Traceability
  - Preventive Risk Control

lifecycle_scope:
  - Model Training
  - Pre-Training Data Assessment
  - Learning Convergence
  - Bias Formation Control
  - Pre-Deployment Assurance

summary: >
  Establishes Algorithm Training Governance as a missing enforcement layer
  in AI oversight. The paper reframes model training as a governed,
  stateful process by introducing learning-state accountability,
  convergence integrity monitoring, bias containment before convergence,
  and mandatory reversibility. It positions training behavior itself
  as a first-class governance concern.

notes: >
  Conceptual governance architecture intended for public thought leadership.
  Complements WP-02 by extending training-time governance beyond data
  ingestion into learning dynamics, convergence behavior, and
  explainability through traceable learning states.
