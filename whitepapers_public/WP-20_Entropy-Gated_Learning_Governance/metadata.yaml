summary: >
  Establishes entropy as a first-class governance signal during model training.
  Proposes uncertainty-gated learning controls to prevent hallucination,
  noise memorization, and latent bias before deployment.

notes: >
  This white paper is conceptual and governance-focused. It introduces
  entropy-based learning control as a policy mechanism, not as an
  implementation specification.
