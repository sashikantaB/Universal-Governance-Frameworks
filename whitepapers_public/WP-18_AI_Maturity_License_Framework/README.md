# WHITE PAPER XVIII

## Overview

This white paper introduces the **AI Maturity License Framework (AML-F)** — a conceptual model for assigning responsibility and liability in autonomous and AI-driven systems based on **demonstrable model maturity**.

Rather than assuming responsibility is fixed at development or deployment time, the framework proposes that **accountability transfers only when sufficient evidence of learning, exposure, and performance exists**. This positions maturity as a prerequisite for autonomy.

## Core Thesis

> Responsibility in AI systems should be proportional to proven maturity, not merely ownership or usage.

Just as humans are granted driving autonomy only after demonstrating sufficient training and competence, AI systems should be treated as **“minors” or “licensed adults”** based on evidence of training quality, scenario coverage, and real-world performance.

Until maturity is proven, **risk and responsibility remain with the creator**.

## Key Contributions

- **Maturity-Based Responsibility Attribution:** Distinguishes developer vs deployer liability  
- **License Analogy Framework:** Maps human learning and licensing to AI readiness  
- **Evidence-Driven Accountability:** Shifts responsibility only when proof exists  
- **Lifecycle Reclassification:** Models can revert to “minor” status due to drift  
- **Governance Bridge:** Resolves the “whose fault is it?” dilemma in AI incidents

## Why This Paper Matters

- Clarifies accountability in autonomous and semi-autonomous systems  
- Prevents premature deployment of under-trained models  
- Incentivizes robust training, validation, and documentation practices  
- Aligns ethical responsibility with technical reality rather than legal ambiguity

## Relationship to Other Papers

This paper complements the governance series by addressing **pre- and mid-deployment accountability boundaries**:

- **WP-07 Algorithm Training Governance:** Defines what “sufficient learning” means  
- **WP-15 Data Preprocessing Governance:** Establishes data adequacy and diversity proof  
- **WP-17 Deployment Governance:** Governs behavior *after* maturity is established  
- **WP-16 Interactive Governance Intelligence:** Supports maturity evaluation via interaction  

WP-18 acts as the **accountability transfer layer**, sitting between training governance and post-deployment governance.

## Intended Audience

- AI Governance & Safety Researchers  
- Responsible AI Architects  
- Model Developers and Platform Builders  
- Risk, Legal, and Compliance Officers  
- Policy and Regulatory Designers
