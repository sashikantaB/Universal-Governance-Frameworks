summary: >
  Proposes an AI maturity-based licensing framework to determine responsibility
  and accountability across the AI lifecycle. Establishes evidence-driven
  thresholds to distinguish developer liability from deployer responsibility
  based on training quality, validation depth, and operational readiness.

notes: >
  Conceptual framework intended for public dissemination. Focuses on accountability,
  maturity verification, and responsibility transfer without defining legal enforcement
  mechanisms or proprietary evaluation systems.
