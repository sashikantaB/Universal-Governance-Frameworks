summary: >
  Introduces a governance framework for algorithm selection and hyperparameter configuration
  in AI systems. Ensures pre-training decisions are justified, approved, and auditable, reducing
  risk and improving traceability before models enter the training pipeline.

notes: >
  Conceptual architecture intended for public dissemination. Complements prior white papers
  (WP-02, WP-07, WP-12) and emphasizes training-time governance discipline without implementation
  or proprietary detail.
