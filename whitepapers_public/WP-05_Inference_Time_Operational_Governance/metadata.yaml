summary: >
  Defines a governance-first framework for enforcing ethical controls
  during inference. Introduces the Inference Governance Loop (IGL)
  to assess, filter, and intervene in real-time AI interactions,
  ensuring high-risk systems remain safe, accountable, and compliant.

notes: >
  This paper serves as the **inference-time operational governance
  companion** to earlier training-time and supervisory white papers.
  It is intended for public thought leadership, academic reference,
  and research discussion.
