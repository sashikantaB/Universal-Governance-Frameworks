summary: >
  Introduces a preventive governance framework for algorithm selection,
  training oversight, and learning-state control. Ensures that AI systems
  make explainable and accountable model choices before deployment,
  minimizing bias, drift, and ungoverned risk.

notes: >
  Conceptual architecture intended for public dissemination. Builds on prior
  white papers (WP-02, WP-05, WP-07) and aligns with frontier AI research
  culture, providing governance-first guidance without implementation claims.
