summary: >
  Introduces a governance-first approach to aligning legacy AI models
  that are already trained on biased or unverified data. Proposes a
  dual-model architecture where high-entropy outputs are blocked,
  never learned, and never propagated—allowing a clean alignment model
  to evolve safely over time.

notes: >
  Conceptual governance architecture intended for public dissemination.
  Focuses on post-training control, entropy-based hallucination prevention,
  and responsible evolution of existing AI systems without disruptive retraining.
