summary: >
  Proposes a governance-first framework for continuous feedback in deployed
  AI systems, combining structured human trust signals with system-generated
  self-assessment. The approach enables early detection of silent failures,
  supports preventive escalation, and strengthens long-term accountability
  beyond static monitoring thresholds.

notes: >
  Conceptual architecture designed for public repositories and thought
  leadership. Extends runtime governance concepts introduced in earlier
  papers (WP-06, WP-09, WP-10) and aligns with frontier AI safety research
  culture without making implementation or performance claims.
