summary: >
  Defines a runtime governance architecture embedding a three-tier AI
  system: Specialist, Coordinator, and Risk Auditor. Introduces
  low-latency inference, real-time risk evaluation, and self-healing
  interventions to maintain safety and ethical alignment.

notes: >
  Serves as a conceptual and operational blueprint for inference-time
  AI governance. Compatible with prior white papers in the series and
  aligned with best practices in high-risk, autonomous, and agentic AI deployments.
