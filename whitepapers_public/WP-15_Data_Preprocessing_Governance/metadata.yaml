summary: >
  Introduces a governance-first framework for data preprocessing,
  treating data transformation as a safety-critical, irreversible
  decision that shapes model behavior. The paper enforces justification,
  lineage traceability, record-level state annotation, synthetic data
  governance, and approval workflows before training begins.

notes: >
  Conceptual white paper intended for public thought leadership.
  Extends shift-left governance by formalizing preprocessing as
  a governed control layer, complementing bias-first, labeling,
  and training-time governance frameworks.
