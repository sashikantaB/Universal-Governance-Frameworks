summary: >
  Introduces a meta-cognitive governance architecture (Guru Gate) that extends
  training-time alignment into inference-time supervision. Ensures task-oriented
  AI agents operate under continuous oversight, aligning outputs with
  immutable ethical constraints and enabling audit-ready, regulation-compliant AI systems.

notes: >
  Conceptual governance architecture intended for public thought leadership.
  Builds on WP-02 (Dharma-Gate) and lays the foundation for operationalization
  in future technical white papers such as AGP (Automated Governance Pipeline).
