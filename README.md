# Universal Governance Frameworks

## Purpose

This repository contains a **unified, domain-agnostic collection of governance frameworks** designed to establish **accountability, oversight, risk management, and decision authority** across complex systems.

While originally developed with **AI and high-risk automated systems** in mind, these frameworks are intentionally structured to be **universal** — applicable to technology, creative systems, leadership, sports, infrastructure, and future autonomous agents.

Governance here is treated as a **human decision system**, not a compliance checklist.

---

## Core Philosophy

Across domains, governance failures follow the same structural patterns:
- Decisions made without ownership
- Risks accepted without disclosure
- Authority delegated without limits
- Oversight defined but not enforced
- Incidents handled reactively instead of structurally

These frameworks aim to prevent those failures by:
- Making authority explicit
- Making risk visible
- Making intervention enforceable
- Making responsibility unavoidable

---

## Repository Structure

This repository is intentionally organized into **two governance layers** to clearly separate **authoritative governance frameworks** from **applied domain examples**.

---

### 🔹 1. **ai_governance_core/** — Core Governance Frameworks

This directory contains **authoritative, system-level AI governance frameworks** that define governance as an **enforceable decision system**, not an advisory or compliance activity.

It includes governance for:
- Decision authority and escalation
- Safety gates and release blocking
- Human oversight and override legitimacy
- Governance failure taxonomy and known failure modes
- Risk tiering, deployment readiness, and incident governance

This directory establishes the **minimum governance baseline** required before introducing:
- Agentic behavior
- Delegated autonomy
- Self-directed AI systems

> These documents are **normative governance artifacts**.  
> They define who can decide, who can block, when systems must stop, and how failures are handled.

See `ai_governance_core/README.md` for detailed coverage.

---

### 🔹 2. **applied_governance_examples/** — Domain Applications

This directory contains **illustrative governance applications** demonstrating how the same governance principles apply across diverse domains.

Included domains:
- **traffic_signal_governance/** — safety-critical civic systems
- **leadership_governance/** — organizational decision authority
- **sports_governance/** — human performance and fairness systems
- **creative_governance/** — creative and cultural decision boundaries

These examples:
- Are **non-authoritative**
- Do **not redefine governance rules**
- Exist to demonstrate **transferability and generality** of governance principles

They inherit from core governance logic rather than introducing new governance authority.

---

### 🔹 3. **Standards & Regulatory References**

Located at the same level as this directory:

- **EU_AI_ACT/**
- **ISO_42001/**
- **NIST_AI_RMF/**
- **ai-development-policy-framework/**

These provide **regulatory and standards context** that inform governance design.

Governance here is **standards-aware but not standards-bound**.

---

### 🔹 4. **CREDENTIALS_AND_TRAINING.md**

Documents certifications, formal education, and formal learning that support the governance perspectives reflected in this repository.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- A collection of technical implementation guides
- A model training or deployment handbook
- A policy-only compliance library
- A theoretical ethics discussion

This repository governs **decisions about systems**, not how systems are built.

---

## Intended Audience

- AI Governance & Responsible AI Specialists
- AI Risk & Safety Professionals
- Trust & Safety Teams
- Infrastructure & Safety Engineers
- Policy Advisors & Regulators
- Organizations preparing for autonomous systems

---

## Future Direction

This repository intentionally progresses toward:
- Agentic AI governance
- Delegated authority frameworks
- Autonomous decision boundary controls
- Human legitimacy in self-directed systems

Agentic governance is treated as an **evolution**, not a leap.
