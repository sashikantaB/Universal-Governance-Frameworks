# AI Governance Baseline Declaration

## Status
This directory represents **AI Governance Baseline v1.0**.

The governance artifacts contained here establish the **minimum authoritative governance structure**
required for high-risk AI systems prior to any agentic or autonomous behavior.

## Scope of Baseline
This baseline defines:
- Governance positioning and scope
- Decision authority and escalation
- Safety gates and release blocking authority
- Governance failure taxonomy and known failure modes
- Human accountability and non-intervention risk

## Change Policy
- This baseline is **frozen for reference and review**
- Changes to existing artifacts require:
  - Explicit version increment
  - Rationale documenting the governance risk addressed
- New work must be added as **extensions**, not modifications

## Forward Evolution
Future governance work may extend this baseline to cover:
- Agentic AI governance
- Delegated authority systems
- Autonomous escalation boundaries

These extensions will not retroactively alter Baseline v1.0

## Effective Date
Baseline v1.0 effective as of: **[2025-12-26]**
