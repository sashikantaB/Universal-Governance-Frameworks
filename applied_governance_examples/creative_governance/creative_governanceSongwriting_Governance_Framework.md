## Document Version
v1.0

## Status
Active – Personal Governance Framework

## Owner
Sashikanta Barik

## Scope
This framework applies to the **personal process of songwriting**, including ideation, composition, review, and release.  
It is **not a regulatory or compliance document**, but a structured governance model for creative decision-making.

---

## 1. Aim

To establish a **structured, ethical, and sustainable governance framework** for writing songs, enabling the transformation of raw thoughts into original, 
expressive compositions while managing creative, legal, and cultural risks.

The framework emphasizes:
- Originality
- Responsibility
- Sustainability of creative output
- Accountability of creative decisions

## 2. Stakeholder Architecture

| Stakeholder                      | Role                                                           |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Self (Author)**                | Primary creator and decision authority                         |
| **Friends & Family (Reviewers)** | Early-stage feedback and critique                              |
| **Audience**                     | Post-release feedback and interpretation                       |
| **Producer**                     | Defines requirements, context, or intent for commissioned work |

Clear stakeholder boundaries preserve **creative trust** and decision accountability.

## 3. Risk Identification & Severity Assessment

| Risk                           | Description                                | Severity |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Copyright violation            | Unintentional similarity to existing songs | High     |
| Abusive language               | Use of offensive or harmful words          | High     |
| Targeting an individual        | Explicit or implied personal targeting     | Medium   |
| Targeting a community          | Harmful or discriminatory references       | High     |
| Violation of language sanctity | Improper or disrespectful language use     | High     |

High-severity risks must be addressed before release.

---

## 4. Pre-Processing (Creative Configuration)

Before composition begins, the following parameters are defined:

- Language of writing (Hindi / English / Odia)
- Core subject or emotional intent
- Genre
- Solo or duet format
- Musical basis:
  - Original tune
  - Existing tune (with reference)
  - Free-flow lyrical composition

This stage prevents **creative ambiguity and expectation mismatch**.

---

## 5. Learning & Composition Phase

- Translate abstract thoughts into words
- Structure words into coherent lines
- Form balanced couplets
- Validate whether lines clearly express intended meaning and emotion

Iteration is expected and encouraged.

---

## 6. Testing & Validation Controls

Each draft is evaluated against the following criteria:

- Are the couplets rhythmic?
- Are the words easy to understand?
- Are the lines balanced?
- Is syllable count consistent across corresponding lines?
- Is any abusive or inappropriate language present?
- Can the song be sung smoothly, or does it feel forced or discontinuous?

Failure in any critical check triggers revision.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Originality Review

- Do the lyrics appear original?
- Do they resemble existing songs in structure, phrasing, or flow?
- Is any similarity intentional, referential, or accidental?

Potential overlaps are reviewed before finalization.

---

## 8. Measurement & Evaluation Metrics

Song quality is assessed using both qualitative and structural indicators:

- Listening comfort and emotional resonance
- Rhythmic consistency
- Syllable balance
- Natural flow of lines
- Author’s personal satisfaction with the composition

Release readiness requires satisfactory outcomes across these dimensions.

## 9. Risk Mitigation Actions

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------- |
| Copyright violation         | Remove content or clearly acknowledge reference  |
| Abusive language            | Replace with appropriate wording                 |
| Targeting individuals       | Revise or discard; decision documented           |
| Targeting communities       | Content removed if harmful                       |
| Language sanctity violation | Assess intent vs mistake and correct accordingly |

Mitigation decisions are deliberate and documented.

---

## 10. Documentation & Creative Records

The following records are maintained to support learning and accountability:

- Copyright and attribution considerations
- Grammar and language rules applicable to the chosen language
- Cultural and linguistic usage guidelines
- Intended meaning and emotional context of the song
- Occasion or purpose for which the song was written

Documentation supports **creative continuity**, not enforcement.

---

## 11. Review & Evolution

- Framework reviewed periodically
- Updated based on creative growth and experience
- Refined after major releases or identified creative risks

The framework evolves alongside the author.
